Each project is organized by platform (e.g., Windows), and contains its own README and build instructions.

## Projects

### windows/CMakeHelloWorld
A minimal CMake project showing how to build and run a simple C++ program on Windows.

### windows/VscodeCMakeClangdLldb
A VSCode debugging setup based on CMakeHelloWorld.  
Includes configuration for clangd, launch.json, and CodeLLDB integration.
